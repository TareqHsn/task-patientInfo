# task-patientInfo

Here i create Api .Net Core Web API using .Net7 to follow the given instruction the Api project name is 'patientInfoSln'
Then i Consume this API project into web(Front-end) which name is 'PatientInfo_WebSln'.
you can run first api project and test in swagger ui where you can insert, update, and delete data. then you go to my Web project which is PatientInfo_WebSln, you may need to set base url(api url)in several page. Then when you run web project you saw interface where api data are stored(erlier you insert in api) then you also create data from here. 

Note: Competency Assignment and SQl script are include here.
That's all
I'm waiting for next step. 
Thanks.
